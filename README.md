# Gdevelop-FuzzyEqualXY
Function/Condition to compare 2 object's x,y floating values and return true, if they are the same as per Fuzzy Logic.

This works by taking two values and a threshold. 
It compares the 2 object's x,y values and if they are within the threshold difference of each other, 
they are considered as being equal
